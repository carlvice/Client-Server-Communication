# Client-Server-Communication

I have created this file while i am learning Java Socket Programming and threads.

To run the program : -

1. Execute SimpleServer.java in command prompt. Keep this command prompt windows open.
2. Execute SimpleClient.java in another command prompt window.
3. Now enter your messages in Client or Server command prompt windows and they will exchange thier messages with each other.
